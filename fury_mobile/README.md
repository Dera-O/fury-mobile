###### In progress:
So far, weâ€™ve developed the android app for the hand-washing reminder app. In this build, contains the primary feature of the app (a reminder message sent to the user to wash their hands).  The IOS build is under development, so as to have our app run on both platforms, after which secondary features can later be added.  
*PS, IOS development to start next week*
